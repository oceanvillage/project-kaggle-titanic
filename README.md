My ranking<br>
![ranking](/assets/ranking.png)<br>
  * Used three best models (XGB,HGBC,GBC) with an ensemble learning (Selected out of various models such as Keras Neural Network, SVC, Random Forest)<br>
  * Achieved 0.78947 ranking 1464 out of 13907, i.e. Top 10% in 11 days (Top 9% if excluding 264 kagglers who scored 1.0) 
  * Very important to squeeze out useful features from the dataset rather just dropping<br>
